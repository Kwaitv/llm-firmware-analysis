\begin{abstract}

Raw binary analysis is a critical task in cyber-security. However, traditional techniques still require cyber-security experts to manually reason through the purpose of even if presented in a decompiled state. This is particularly true in the case of micro-controller firmware and the assembly associated with various peripherals. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to parse and understand human-readable code. This project seeks to extend this notion programmatic understanding beyond human-readable codes towards that of compiled binaries, particularly in the embedded space with hardware peripherals not explicitly delineated in the ISA of a microprocessor.
